### MIDTERM:
Make a project that interests and excites you using 3 things we have learned so far (including loops) and 3 new things we have not touched on in class yet – find something that is interesting to you and experiment with it!

Figure out how to execute what you have in mind with the tools on the Processing website & Google as a whole.

####Think about the projects we’ve shown you in class for inspiration.
Perhaps you want to make an interactive narrative piece, or use audio, or just make some awesome interactive art with key & mouse inputs.
