### DAY 10: Data Visualization

### Key Concepts

* Datasets, Web Scraping
* Bubble visualization

=======

### Homework:

For this weekend's homework I want you to choose between 2: 

* Continue the Space Invaders (add different types of enemies! add barriers! etc) or if you are thinking to create other Games for your final, I want you start on that and on Monday we'll see your progress together and give feedbacks. 
* 2nd option: Make a simple Data Viz. Using the datasets we have (or you can start fresh with a new simple dataset!), create new visualizations other than Bubble! Try lines, rectangles, pie chart, abstract artistic piece, or whatever. I want you guys to be pretty comfortable with displaying data visually. This is a really great skill to learn! And you can also continue it if you're thinking to proceed for Final.
